A to B is ML
Having an input to generate an output 
Machine learning is the field of study that give computers the ability to learn without being explicily programmed
Example: House size | Bed rooms | ----> Price of home

Data Science is having an a set of insights to make decisions. 
Example: From the data, did you know, if a home is newly renovated, it is 15 percent more expensive
Data science is the science of extracting knowledge and insight from data
Not formalized meanings, ML and data Science

Deep learning (Artifical Neural network)
Tasks input A, outputs B,(estimated)
Neural Network is just a big mathmatical equation (Given the input A, how do you compute B)

How to be an AI company
1) excute pilot projects to gain momentum
2) Build an inhouse AI Team
3) Provide broad AI training
4) develop an AI strategy
5) Develope interal and external communication

Understand what AI can and cannot do
Supervised learning: If you can do it 1 second of thought, we can probably now or soon to automate using Supervised learning. (Input to output mapping)
Something it cant do is analyse a market and write a 50 page report. 
Rules of thumb to help determine if it is a feasible project
1) Learning a simple concept (1 second of thought)
2) Lots of data Available, Lots of input A, and Labeling of B
3) Does it require high accuracy 

Strength and weakness
ML tends to work well when learning simple concepts, and has lots of data
ML tends to work poorly when learning complex concepts with little data, 
also works poorly on new types of data (example, xrays from one hospital, and trying to use the same AI systems to a different hospital with a different way of taking xrays)
A good AI team may be able to mitigate this issues, but it is not easy
