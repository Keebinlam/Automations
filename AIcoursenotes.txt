Week 1
A to B is ML
Having an input to generate an output 
Machine learning is the field of study that give computers the ability to learn without being explicily programmed
Example: House size | Bed rooms | ----> Price of home

Data Science is having an a set of insights to make decisions. 
Example: From the data, did you know, if a home is newly renovated, it is 15 percent more expensive
Data science is the science of extracting knowledge and insight from data
Not formalized meanings, ML and data Science

Deep learning (Artifical Neural network)
Tasks input A, outputs B,(estimated)
Neural Network is just a big mathmatical equation (Given the input A, how do you compute B)

How to be an AI company
1) excute pilot projects to gain momentum
2) Build an inhouse AI Team
3) Provide broad AI training
4) develop an AI strategy
5) Develope interal and external communication

Understand what AI can and cannot do
Supervised learning: If you can do it 1 second of thought, we can probably now or soon to automate using Supervised learning. (Input to output mapping)
Something it cant do is analyse a market and write a 50 page report. 
Rules of thumb to help determine if it is a feasible project
1) Learning a simple concept (1 second of thought)
2) Lots of data Available, Lots of input A, and Labeling of B
3) Does it require high accuracy 

Strength and weakness
ML tends to work well when learning simple concepts, and has lots of data
ML tends to work poorly when learning complex concepts with little data, 
also works poorly on new types of data (example, xrays from one hospital, and trying to use the same AI systems to a different hospital with a different way of taking xrays)
A good AI team may be able to mitigate this issues, but it is not easy

Week 2
How to do an AI project
Objective
1) Workflow of the project
2)Selecting an AI project
3) organized data and Team for the project

---Workflow for AI project
Key steps
1)Collect Data
2) Train the model, use ML algo to learn A to B (iterate many time)
3) Deploy model (to ship to user, get data back, and maintain/update model to new data)


---Workflow for Data science project (output is to set up actionable insights)
Key steps 
1) collect data
2) Analyze Data 
3) Distill idea and suggest hypothese/action (reanalze data after implementation)

How to choose an AI project
find the intersection of what AI can do, and what the company values
Ai Experts has a good idea of what AI can and cannot do
Domain expert have best sense what is value for the business
Bring team comprising AI and domain brainstorm and idenfity projects
"cross functional teams"

---- Brainstorming framework
1)Think about automating tasks rather than automating jobs 
2) what are the drivers of business values
3) What are the main pain points in your business
You can make progress without big data
Having more data almost never hurts
data makes business defensable
you can make progress can still make progress

---- Double check if the project is worth committing months to weeks of effort
1) Due diligence on projects (spend time making sure it is feasible)
Technical diligence
- Technical diligence is the process of making sure that the AI system you hope built is doable
- How much is data is needed
- Engineering timeline, how much time and people to make this project

Business diligience 
1) Making sure that the AI project is actually valable for the team (value driving)
-  Lower cost 
- increase revenue
- launch a new product or business

Creating estimated value of project to model economic esstation before commiting to project

Ethical diligence
- make sure what is being built make the world better 

Build Vs buy
ML projects can be in house or outsourced
DS project are more commenly inhouse (requires deep day to day knowledge to extract meaning from informaton)
Some thing will be industry standard and avoid building those 
***Build the things that are specialze to you
Buy things that are industry standard


Working with an AI team
** Take course on Deep Learning / Machine Learning
1) speifiy your acceptance criteria
2)Provide AI team a dateset on which to measure their performance (TEST SET) In stattical manner

How AI think about data
- Training set and test set
Training set give inputs and their outcomes (Learn)
Test set, give AI data, and the data that comes out from the test is the test set.
Validation test set is the second test set

some pitfalls
1) limitations of ML
2) Not enough data
3) Mislabling data
4) data is ambigious

Technical tools AI teams use
Machine Learning Frameworks: Tensorflow, Pytorch, Keras, Mxnet, CNTK, Caffe, Paddlepaddle, Scikit-learn, R, weka 
These are open source machine learning frameworks

Research publication: Arxiv

Open source repsorityy
github


Week 3
-- Topics
AI project for companies
multiple modules in a complex AI system 
roles in an AI team
AI transformation playbook
Taking your first step


AI smart speaker case study (Steps to process command)
1) Trigger words/ wakeword detection (A to B mapping)
2) speech recognition (differen A to B mapping)
3) intent recognition 
4) excute joke (Specalized program to execute command)
__ AI Pipeline__
A team built for each component of the AI Pipeline

Self driving car case study
1) detection
2) tragtoery prediction
2) Motion Planning (tell what path you should drive. Deteremines speed and direction)

Roles on an AI team
1) Software Engineers (Create the programs for execution)
2) Machine Learning Engineers (Creates the software to generate the A to B Mapping, or algo)
3) Machine Learning Researcher (Extend the state of the art in ML)
4) Data Science (Examine data and provide insight, present data)
5) Data Engineers (Help organize data, Make sure it safe, secure, and cost effective)
6) AI Product Manager (help decide what is feasible and what to build)

AI transformation playbook
1)Excute pilot project to gain momentum
2)Build an in house AI team
3)Provide broad Ai training
4) Develop an AI strategy
5) Develop internal and external communication

1)Excute pilot project to gain momentum
-More important for the initial project to succeed rather than be the most valueable
-Show traction within to 6 to 12 months
- Can be inhouse or outsourced

2) Build an inhouse AI Team
-A centralized AI that is matrix across the Org business units. 
- Build Company wide platform

3) Broad AI training

4) Develop an AI strategy
- Leverage AI to create an advantage specific to your industry sector
- Design strategy aligned with a "Virtuous Cycle of AI" (More data from process to feed back into AI to make product better)
-Consider creating a data Strat (data aquisition, unified data warehouse)
- Create network effect and platform advantage

5)Develop internal and external communication
-Investor relations
-government relations
-Consumer
-Talent / recuritment
-Internal communication

Common Pittfalls
---- Donts
dont expect AI can do everything
hire 2 or 3 ML Engineering to soley come up with use cases 
dont expect the project to work on the first time
dont expect tradiconal planning process to apply without changes
Dont think you need an AI superstar AI engineer before you can do anything

----- Dos
Be realistic, making sure you do your diligence
pair Engineering talent and business talent to work crossfunctionally on feasible projects
plan for AI developemt to be an Iteritive with multiple attempts to succeed
Work with AI team to estblish timeline estimates, milestones and KPIs
Keep building and try to get with what you have 

First steps in AI
1) get friends to learn about AI
2) Start Brainf storming projects
3) Hire a few ML/DS people to help
4) Appoint an AI leader
5)Discuss with CEO of possiblility of AI transformation

AI understanding images (Computer vision)
AI understanding text or speech (Natural Langauge processing)

Unsupervised Learning 
1) Clustering (given data, without anything specific, to find something interesting about the data)
2) Transfer learning 
3) Reinforcement learning (Doing more of the good things"Reward signal", and doing less bad things "negative signal")learn to maximize Reward
a weakness for Reinforcementlearning, it requires a lot of data to behave better
4) GANS Generative Adverserial Network, systheis new image from sctratch 
5) knowledge graph, 

Week 4
Limitation
-Bias/ discrimanate 
-open to attacks
- performance
- explainablity is hard 

how to limit discrimnation
Technical Solution: zero out bias in words
use less bias and use more inclusive data
have transparacy to recognition Bias
diverse workforce, more likely to spot issues

what is Adverserial attacks?
fouling it to doing something different
