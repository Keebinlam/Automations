_____Tree structure for webscraping________

Root Element = <artical>
    artical (attribute/ Class= "main-artica" )
    Element <h1> (text "titanic 1997"): which is the title
    Element <p> (attribute class= "plot"), (Text = "84 years later"): which is the decription
    Element <div> (attribute class= "full script"), (Text = "13 meters): which is the transcript

attribute/ text node cannot have children. Parent nodes can have several child nodes

_______Xpath - Syntax_________
xpath stands for XML path Lang, it is a query lang for selecting node from a xml doc. But we can use it to select html pages or css selectors

xpath syntax 
A way to select an element use "//(tagname)" can be used to find all of that element. ie Picking a matching node with x tagname 
//tagname
We can also get the element by its position by using the square brackets [] and putting the position number within the brackects 
//tagname[3] 
We can also speific an element with a speific attribute
//tagname[@attributeName="Value"]

Can use functions for find elements 
contain() = find text that contains value inside the parathensesis 
example: //tagname[contains(@attributeName, "Value")]
starts-with()

Can also use and/or operators with xpath expression
example: //tagname[(expression1) and (expression2)]
